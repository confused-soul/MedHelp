# Med-Help: Empowering Healthcare Access in the Digital Age

### Tech-Stack :

1. *Django* : Django is a high-level open-source web framework for Python that simplifies web application development. It provides features like a powerful database system, a customizable admin interface, URL routing, and security measures. Django encourages best practices and offers tools for building web applications efficiently. It's known for its flexibility and is commonly used for a wide range of web projects, from simple websites to complex applications.
2. *FastAPI* : FastAPI is a modern, fast, and highly efficient web framework for building web APIs with Python. It is designed to be easy to use, while also being incredibly performant. FastAPI leverages Python type hints to automatically generate documentation and validate incoming requests, making it a popular choice for building RESTful APIs quickly and robustly.
3. *Machine-Learning Model*: Supervised Learning Classification Model - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is a machine learning algorithm used for separating data into two or more classes. It finds a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes, making it effective for both simple and complex classification tasks. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data, are robust against overfitting, and can handle imbalanced datasets. However, they can be computationally intensive and may lack interpretability. They work well in situations where you need a clear boundary between classes.
4. *Bootstrap* : Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework that simplifies web design by providing pre-designed styles and components for creating responsive and visually appealing web pages. While it includes optional JavaScript components to enhance interactivity, it is primarily a CSS framework, not a comprehensive JavaScript framework. Bootstrap helps developers build consistent and attractive web interfaces with ease.
